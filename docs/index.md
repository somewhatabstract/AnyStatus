title: AnyStatus extension for Visual Studio
---

**AnyStatus** is a visual studio extension which adds monitoring capabilities to Visual Studio to enable developers monitor their development environment and other resources and applications on-premise or on the cloud. 

With AnyStatus you can monitor Windows Services, HTTP servers, send Ping requests, check TCP ports, monitor GitHub Issues, monitor builds on Team Foundation Server, Jenkins, TeamCity, AppVeyor...and much more. All from within Visual Studio.

AnyStatus runs in the background and does not have a significant impact on the performance or startup of Visual Studio. Moreover, it loads only when the tool window is activated.

See the [changelog](changelog) for changes and roadmap.

# AnyStatus

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/t7j7rnnci6lvv8jl?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AlonAmsalem/anystatus)

AnyStatus is a free and open source Visual Studio extension that adds basic monitoring capabilities to Visual Studio for resources and applications you run on your development and other environments. AnyStatus can monitor Build Status, Ping, TCP and HTTP response status code. More status and health checks will be added in future versions. AnyStatus runs in the background and does not have a significant impact on the performance or startup of Visual Studio.

**Note:** This is an alpha version that comes with an incomplete set of basic features and has some known issues. I will be constantly working on AnyStatus to make sure every bug is fixed and all designed features are implemented.
